# Data Analytics Assignments

## Homework #1

In this homework, we analyze car crash data and perform EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis. This step takes care of null, missing values and outliers, calculates simple statistics with SQL and Pandas library with the goal of getting initial insight into the data set. Additionally, we explore the calculation of skew and correlation between the data and use box plots, scatter plots and histograms to introduce a visual element to data analysis.

## Homework #2

This homework is divided into two parts:   
* The first one uses housing data to build a Linear Regression. After performing EDA and using pairplots to identify correlation, the data is split into training and test data for the linear model. The model is validated with a 10 fold cross validation to ensure the R-squared value obtained stays relatively the same when the data set is divided into different groups.  
* The second part uses affair data to build a logistic regression. The EDA uses a heatmap to find missing values in the data set that needed to be dropped, and the use of dummy variables are introduced and used. Factor plots are used to obtain insights for the ratio of having and not having an affair based on different data within the data set. Finally, data is slit into training and test data for the proposed logistic model.

## Homework #3

Still using the affair data set, this homework further explores the use of models that allow for classification. The models used include Support Vector Classifier with a wide variety of C parameter, Kernel and Gamma values; Decision Trees with different depths, gini and entropy criterion. The trees are plotted to show the values that determine the splits in a tree.

## Final Project

For the final project, we incorporate the techniques learned in the homeworks aiming to explore and analyze loan data to find which loans are more likely to not be paid. EDA is performed and relationships are explored with a variety of plots and graphs, dummy variables are used, data is split into train and test data with further cross validation to confirm results are not flawed. The models used in the final project include Logistic Regressions, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifiers and Naive Bayes. As done in the homework, models are run with multiple parameters and cross validated.
